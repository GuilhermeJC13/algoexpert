# OPTIMAL FREELANCING

  ## Prompt

  Write a function that takes in a non-empty string and that returns a boolean
  representing whether the string is a palindrome.

  A palindrome is defined as a string that's written the same forward and
  backward. Note that single-character strings are palindromes.
  

  ## Solutions
  ### Solution 1
  Traverse the string and compare the element in the begining with the one in the end, and keep doing that with the next elements, if they are always the same, then it is a palindrome
