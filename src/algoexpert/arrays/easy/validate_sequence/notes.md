# VALIDATE SEQUENCE

  ## Prompt
  Given two non-empty arrays of integers, write a function that determines
  whether the second array is a subsequence of the first one.

  A subsequence of an array is a set of numbers that aren't necessarily adjacent
  in the array but that are in the same order as they appear in the array. For
  instance, the numbers 

  ## Solutions
  ### Solution 1
  I actually did this in less then 5 minutes. Basically if the sequence is actually sequential, then I could just go trough the array and count if I found any of the sequence, so I could easily finish. 

  Time Complexity: O(n)
